<h2>Autodiscovery</h2>

<p>This mechanism lets someone (or software) find your profile document from your homepage.</p>


<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="bullet-list">
	<li>Your data can be easily discovered and therefore is more useful</li>
	<li>No manual input required</li>
	<li>By providing a link from the homepage to the OPD, and from the OPD to your datasets, it indicates that these are authoritative from your organisation otherwise there would be no way to distinguish official data from other data</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does autodiscovery work?</h2>

<p>We offer two ways to get equipment.data.ac.uk to discover your profile document.</p>

<h3>1. &lt;link&gt; header</h3>

<p>This method of auto discovery uses a header on your organisation homepage header:
<code class="code block">&lt;link rel=&quot;openorg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.example.ac.uk/profile.ttl&quot; /&gt;</code>
Which links to the profile document.</p>

<h3>2. Well-known</h3>

<p>This method uses a specific URL from your university homepage to link to the profile document; if your homepage is http://www.example.ac.uk then http://www.example.ac.uk/.well-known/openorg should serve (or redirect to) your profile document.</p>


<h3>Can’t do either of these methods?</h3>

<p>We understand that the team providing equipment and facilities data for your organisation won’t always be working hand-in-glove with the team that run the homepage and main website. If the above methods are impractical for you, drop our admin a line at support@data.ac.uk and they will manually register the URL of your profile document.</p>
